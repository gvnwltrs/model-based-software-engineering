# model-based-software-engineering

## Background

I have been working in the software industry for 7 years now. I have started with and still work with working on software in the robotics domain. Having seen many things that work and don't work, I want to be more methodical using principled and disciplined engineering approach to software to deepen my understanding of the software I write or learn about through reverse engineering. My intent is to take something from recognized engineering disciplines and use it for software development under an Agile type framework.  

## Goal
Structure a more disciplined approach to software engineering using a model based approach to write code with less defects and a lot less reliance on tests at the end of a development cycle.
